🎉 Our paper “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00293">PepPre: Promote Peptide Identification Using Accurate and Comprehensive Precursors</a>” has been accepted by <i>Journal of Proteome Research</i>!
<div>Note:
<ol>
    <li>add experimental features for global peptide precursor analysis.</li>
    <li>support .mes input, which is a binary format and is much faster than text-base formats.</li>
    <li>able to split output into batches to support large data from instrument such as Astral.</li>
    <li>support .pf2 output, which is commonly used by software from pFind Team.</li>
    <li>improved UI.</li>
